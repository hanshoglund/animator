- Split Prim module

- What about read/show/read_/show_?

- What about undefined?                                           
    - JS to HS
        - It would be elegant to have JS undefined map to HS undefined
        - The dynamic type checks can catch this, but we do not always want that
        - For return values, we could always use an extra primitive, i.e.
            function(x) { x===undefined ? T(die.bind(null,"undefined")) : null }

- Js-aware collection types:
    Data.TypedArray
    Data.TypedArray.Mutable
    Data.TypedArray.Immutable
